# 337-Final-Project

This is our final project a web-based 2D platformer similar to Celeste or Kirby. The user is able to create an account and log in. The login allows the user's time to be stored in a database so it can be displayed in the fastest times. The passwords that the user creates are salted and hashed for security purposes. 

The user will play as the main protagonist: buff kirby and the object of the game is to complete all three levels with the fastest time. The user is able to move buff kirby by using the ASDW keyboard inputs. 
"A" moves the character left; "S" moves the character down; "W" moves the character up; "D" moves the character right. The game has built-in enemies that move left and right. There are powerups and objects "shakes" that the player is trying to collect. Unfortunately, the functionality of the powerups and obtaining the 'shakes" do not fully work.
